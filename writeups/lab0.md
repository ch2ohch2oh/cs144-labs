Lab 0 Writeup
=============

`telnet` can be used to establish a TCP connection to
a remote host. 

OS: provides functinality to reliable deliver bidirectional 
in-order byte stream between two programs. This is 
what TCP does.

Internet: best effort delivery of internet datagrams.

There are some guidelines about how to 
write modern C++ which is mostly safe in the lab0 handout.

`webget` is pretty easy. 

`byte_stream` is not hard either. A `deque<char>` would 
be enough. There are some places where I did not check
the boundary but it passed all the tests.

Overall, lab 0 is easy. Setting up the environment would
take some time thouhgh. It took me about 1~2 hours to
finish lab 0.
